store the serialized form of Python objects. This means objects like list, set, tuple, dict, etc. are converted to a character stream before being stored on the disk. This allows you to continue working with the objects later on. These are particularly useful when you have trained your machine learning model and want to save them to make predictions later on.\n","\n","- So, if you serialized the files before saving them, you need to de-serialize them before you use them in your Python programs.
